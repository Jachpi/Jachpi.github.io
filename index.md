# Javier Chouza's Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! Here are some interesting projects I have worked on:

## Featured Projects
- [Transport Helper](https://github.com/HevCuesta/TransportHelper) â€” A mobile app designed for TEA teenagers to help them use Madrid's public transportation independently. Presented at the TalenTEA contest and won first place in the trasTEA competition.
- [Food Advisor](https://github.com/Proyecto-de-Computacion-I-y-II/Front) â€” A full-stack web app developed for the *Proyecto de ComputaciÃ³n I y II* course.

**Frontend:** Built with TypeScript, HTML, and CSS, offering a user-friendly interface.  
**Backend:** Developed with PHP and Blade, managing server logic and database operations.  

FoodAdvisor allows users to create shopping lists and search for foods across supermarkets with filters. It provides AI-powered recommendations based on the ONU food pyramid and prioritizes seasonal foods for a balanced, cost-effective diet.

## What I am currently doing
- [Hermopolis](https://github.com/rafagithub15/hermopolis) â€” This project aims to design innovative urban spaces. I am developing AI-based human pose detection for community areas to practice taekwondo and yoga.
