# Javier Chouza's Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio!! Here are some interesting curiosities I have worked on:

## Featured Projects
- [Transport Helper](https://github.com/HevCuesta/TransportHelper) â€” This mobile app was designed for TEA teenagers to help them become more independent when using Madrid's public transportation, such as buses and subways. This project was presented at TalenTEA contest for digital solutions organized by FederaciÃ³n Autismo Madrid, and it has won first place in the trasTEA competition.
- [Food Advisor](https://github.com/Proyecto-de-Computacion-I-y-II/Front) â€” FoodAdvisor is a full-stack web application developed for the Proyecto de ComputaciÃ³n I y II course. It consists of:

Frontend: Built with TypeScript, HTML, and CSS, offering a user-friendly interface.

Backend: Developed with PHP and Blade, managing server logic and database operations.

FoodAdvisor helps users create shopping lists and search for foods across supermarkets with various filters. It provides AI-powered recommendations to complement your cart based on the ONU food pyramid, promoting a balanced diet. Recommendations prioritize seasonal foods, helping you find fresher, healthier, and more cost-effective options.

## What I am currently doing
- [Hermopolis](https://github.com/rafagithub15/hermopolis) â€” This project aims to design modern, innovative spaces for urban environments. I am currently responsible for developing AI-based human pose detection to support creating open areas where the community can practice taekwondo and yoga.
